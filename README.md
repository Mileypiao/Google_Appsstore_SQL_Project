# Google_Appsstore_SQL_Project


The original data source is obtained from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps). 
 
The data was collected in April 2019 by Gautham Prakash and  Jithin Koshy. We consider this data as an important one as it records details of all applications published in Google Play store by April 2019. The mobile application is playing a more and more important role in various industries. Evaluating this dataset may help future app developers build a better understanding of the market.  

The analysis we conducted was mainly focus on:
- What is the minimum rating value of an application to maintain competitive in its category in the Google Play store? 
- In which categories are the applications under the most competitive pressure?
- Should app developers limit the size of an application when considering rating and installation numbers?
- What is the size of the top 5 application in each category based on the installation number or rating number?
- Which category has the most paid applications? 
- Are the rating scores of paid applications higher than the average rating of unpaid applications in their categories? 
- What is the relationship between price and installations of applications in their categories? 
- How many applications with top 1% installations are paid ones in a certain category?
